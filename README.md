# Human Mobility Pattern Mining in Japan
This repository contains the source code, experimental results, and analysis for our project on **data mining and prediction using human mobility data** in Japan. The project covers three major tasks: frequent pattern discovery, sequential pattern mining, and next-location prediction using deep learning techniques.

## ðŸ“Œ Abstract
This project explores various data mining techniques to analyze and predict human mobility patterns using real-world location data collected in Japan.    

The key objectives and tasks include:

1. **Frequent POI Identification**  
   Applied the **Apriori algorithm** to discover frequently visited Points-of-Interest (POIs) across the dataset.
2. **Mobility Pattern Mining**  
   Implemented the **Generalized Sequential Pattern (GSP)** algorithm to identify common movement sequences among residents.
3. **Next Location Prediction**  
   Developed a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** model to forecast a userâ€™s next location based on historical movement trajectories.

For each task, we integrated optimized algorithms, implemented detailed pre-processing pipelines, and evaluated our methods based on accuracy and efficiency.
